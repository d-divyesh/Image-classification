# Cat and Dog Classification using CNN

## Overview

This project is a Cat and Dog classification system built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with TensorFlow and Keras. It allows users to upload images of cats or dogs and classifies them accurately. The model is trained on a well-known dataset containing thousands of cat and dog images.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for image upload.
- Accurate classification of images as either ‘Cat’ or ‘Dog’.
- Built with deep learning techniques using CNNs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
- Other libraries as mentioned in the requirements.txt

## Dataset

The model is trained on the [Kaggle Cats vs. Dogs dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data). Make sure to download the dataset and place it in the designated folder before running the code.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
  
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   
2. Install required packages:
  
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. Download the dataset and update the path in the notebook.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
  
   jupyter notebook
   
2. Run the code cells sequentially to train the model.

3. Upload an image using the provided interface to classify it as a cat or a dog.
